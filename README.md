# Phaser React TypeScript Template

This is a Phaser 3 project template that uses the React framework and Vite for bundling. It includes a bridge for React to Phaser game communication, hot-reloading for quick development workflow and scripts to generate production-ready builds.

**[This Template is also available as a JavaScript version.](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-react)**

### Versions

This template has been updated for:

- [Phaser 3.90.0](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)
- [React 19.0.0](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [Vite 6.3.1](https://github.com/vitejs/vite)
- [TypeScript 5.7.2](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript)

## Requirements

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is required to install dependencies and run scripts via `npm`.

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm install` | Install project dependencies |
| `npm run dev` | Launch a development web server |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder |
| `npm run dev-nolog` | Launch a development web server without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |
| `npm run build-nolog` | Create a production build in the `dist` folder without sending anonymous data (see "About log.js" below) |

## Writing Code

After cloning the repo, run `npm install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development server by running `npm run dev`.

The local development server runs on `http://localhost:8080` by default. Please see the Vite documentation if you wish to change this, or add SSL support.

Once the server is running you can edit any of the files in the `src` folder. Vite will automatically recompile your code and then reload the browser.

## React Bridge

The `PhaserGame.tsx` component is the bridge between React and Phaser. It initializes the Phaser game and passes events between the two.

To communicate between React and Phaser, you can use the **EventBus.ts** file. This is a simple event bus that allows you to emit and listen for events from both React and Phaser.

```js
// In React
import { EventBus } from './EventBus';

// Emit an event
EventBus.emit('event-name', data);

// In Phaser
// Listen for an event
EventBus.on('event-name', (data) => {
    // Do something with the data
});
```

In addition to this, the `PhaserGame` component exposes the Phaser game instance along with the most recently active Phaser Scene using React ref.

## Phaser Scene Handling

In Phaser, the Scene is the lifeblood of your game. It is where you sprites, game logic and all of the Phaser systems live. You can also have multiple scenes running at the same time. This template provides a way to obtain the current active scene from React.

You can get the current Phaser Scene from the component event `"current-active-scene"`. In order to do this, you need to emit the event `"current-scene-ready"` from the Phaser Scene class. This event should be emitted when the scene is ready to be used. You can see this done in all of the Scenes in our template.

**Important**: When you add a new Scene to your game, make sure you expose to React by emitting the `"current-scene-ready"` event via the `EventBus`, like this:


```ts
class MyScene extends Phaser.Scene
{
    constructor ()
    {
        super('MyScene');
    }

    create ()
    {
        // Your Game Objects and logic here

        // At the end of create method:
        EventBus.emit('current-scene-ready', this);
    }
}
```

You don't have to emit this event if you don't need to access the specific scene from React. Also, you don't have to emit it at the end of `create`, you can emit it at any point. For example, should your Scene be waiting for a network request or API call to complete, it could emit the event once that data is ready.

**Important**: Let's consider 2 examples.

1. 
```ts
class MyScene extends Phaser.Scene
{
    constructor ()
    {
        super('MyScene');
    }

    preload ()
    {
        this.load.image('background', 'assets/bg.png');
    }

    create ()
    {
        // Your Game Objects and logic here

        // At the end of create method:
        EventBus.emit('current-scene-ready', this);
    }
}
```

Here we load some resource via `LoaderPlugin`, when the loading is complete - the `create` method starts. It is important to understand that in this case we have some delay before the start of the `create` method (transferred to a macro task because resource loading happens asynchronously via browser APIs like XHR etc.), and therefore the event will be sent later. This delay gives time to subscribe to the event in `useEffect`. This is important, because we create the game in `useLayoutEffect`, which is executed before paint, and `useEffect` is executed after, so if there is no delay before sending the event from the game - the subscription to the event in `useEffect` will not have time to be executed, and the event from the game will already be sent to nowhere, that is, we will not catch this event, since we subscribe to the event after the event has already been sent.

2.
```ts
class MyScene extends Phaser.Scene
{
    constructor ()
    {
        super('MyScene');
    }

    preload ()
    {
        // LoaderPlugin does not load anything
    }

    create ()
    {
        // Your Game Objects and logic here

        // At the end of create method:
        EventBus.emit('current-scene-ready', this);
    }
}
```

In this example, we are not loading anything, so the `create` method is executed synchronously right after the `preload` method. Since we have no delay before sending the event, we do not have time to subscribe to it and do not receive this event.

**Note:** You may notice that you still receive the event in `React.StrictMode`. However, this is a **false positive** result, and it is misleading! This can be easily verified by removing `React.StrictMode`, or generating a production build (which automatically removes it), where you will see that you are not receiving the event again. So why do we still get an event in `React.StrictMode`?

This is because `React.StrictMode` runs the effects twice to check for bugs. So we get the following:

**[first iteration]**

1. Creating the game in `useLayoutEffect`.
2. Sending the `"current-scene-ready"` event.
3. Subscribing to the `"current-scene-ready"` event in `useEffect`. Here we did not receive the event, because the event was sent before we had time to subscribe.

**[transition between iterations]**

4. Cleaning - the functions that are placed in the `return` of the effects are executed.

    4.1 Deleting the game. **Attention!** When we run `game.destroy()` Phaser does not delete it immediately, instead it sets the `pendingDestroy` flag, which schedules the deletion for the next frame in `requestAnimationFrame`.
    
    4.2 Unsubscribing from the event.

**[second iteration]**

5. Creating the game in `useLayoutEffect`. **Attention!** The creation of the game also does not happen immediately. The game instance constructor is executed, in which the game is initialized, where the game render is created via `requestAnimationFrame`, and the actual game updates themselves occur in the render, i.e. the creation of the first scene also occurs in the render. This means that at the moment we have initialized the game, but have not yet created the scene, since its creation occurs in the render, which means it is scheduled for the next frame.
6. Deleting the old game instance and launching the first tick of the new game are scheduled at this moment. However, since deleting the old game instance took quite a long time, so much so that it took up the entire time of one frame, which is ~ 16ms (at 60 frames per second), there was no time left to execute the first tick (render step) of the new game, since the browser tries to maintain a stable frame rate - this first step of the new game is **skipped**, and therefore the scene in which we send the event is not created. **Attention!** You should not rely on the fact that deleting the old game instance definitely guarantees the first step of rendering the new game instance in the next frame. It all depends on how long the deletion will take. Depending on the Phaser versions, deletion can take different amounts of time due to different implementations. Theoretically, deleting the old game and executing the first render step of the new game can happen in the same frame, in which case we will not receive the event again, since we will not have time to subscribe to it yet.
7. Subscription to the `"current-scene-ready"` event in the `useEffect`. Now we have time to subscribe to the event before it is sent. Why? Because the game scene in which the event is sent has not yet been created, since it was delayed by the heavy/long deletion of the previous game instance in the same frame.
8. The first step of rendering the new game instance is performed, where the scene is created and the `"current-scene-ready"` event is sent. Since the subscription to the event has already been executed, we receive this event.

So how do you solve this and subscribe to an event faster than it is sent?

It is enough to wrap the sending of the event in a `setTimeout`, which guarantees subscription to the event before it is sent as shown below. Why is a zero delay in the set timeout sufficient? Because the set timeout creates a macro task regardless of the specified delay, which is guaranteed to be executed not in the current frame, but at least in the next one, which is what we need.

```ts
class MyScene extends Phaser.Scene
{
    constructor ()
    {
        super('MyScene');
    }

    preload ()
    {
        // LoaderPlugin does not load anything
    }

    create ()
    {
        // Your Game Objects and logic here

        // At the end of create method:
        setTimeout(() => {
            EventBus.emit('current-scene-ready', this);
        }, 0);
    }
}
```

**Note:** `scene.time.delayedCall(0, ...)` also does not guarantee that we will have time to subscribe, since it is checked for each frame of the Phaser rendering and if specified with a small delay (less than before the start of the next frame), then we will not have time to subscribe, since `useEffect` will not start yet.

Once event subscriptions are already set, subsequent game events can be sent without a `setTimeout`.

Fun :D.

### React Component Example

Here's an example of how to access Phaser data for use in a React Component:

```ts
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { IRefPhaserGame } from "./game/PhaserGame";

// In a parent component
const ReactComponent = () => {

    const phaserRef = useRef<IRefPhaserGame>(); // you can access to this ref from phaserRef.current

    const onCurrentActiveScene = (scene: Phaser.Scene) => {
    
        // This is invoked

    }

    return (
        ...
        <PhaserGame ref={phaserRef} currentActiveScene={onCurrentActiveScene} />
        ...
    );

}
```

In the code above, you can get a reference to the current Phaser Game instance and the current Scene by creating a reference with `useRef()` and assign to PhaserGame component.

From this state reference, the game instance is available via `phaserRef.current.game` and the most recently active Scene via `phaserRef.current.scene`.

The `onCurrentActiveScene` callback will also be invoked whenever the the Phaser Scene changes, as long as you emit the event via the EventBus, as outlined above.

## Handling Assets

Vite supports loading assets via JavaScript module `import` statements.

This template provides support for both embedding assets and also loading them from a static folder. To embed an asset, you can import it at the top of the JavaScript file you are using it in:

```js
import logoImg from './assets/logo.png'
```

To load static files such as audio files, videos, etc place them into the `public/assets` folder. Then you can use this path in the Loader calls within Phaser:

```js
preload ()
{
    //  This is an example of an imported bundled image.
    //  Remember to import it at the top of this file
    this.load.image('logo', logoImg);

    //  This is an example of loading a static image
    //  from the public/assets folder:
    this.load.image('background', 'assets/bg.png');
}
```

When you issue the `npm run build` command, all static assets are automatically copied to the `dist/assets` folder.

## Deploying to Production

After you run the `npm run build` command, your code will be built into a single bundle and saved to the `dist` folder, along with any other assets your project imported, or stored in the public assets folder.

In order to deploy your game, you will need to upload *all* of the contents of the `dist` folder to a public facing web server.

## Customizing the Template

### Vite

If you want to customize your build, such as adding plugin (i.e. for loading CSS or fonts), you can modify the `vite/config.*.mjs` file for cross-project changes, or you can modify and/or create new configuration files and target them in specific npm tasks inside of `package.json`. Please see the [Vite documentation](https://vitejs.dev/) for more information.

## About log.js

If you inspect our node scripts you will see there is a file called `log.js`. This file makes a single silent API call to a domain called `gryzor.co`. This domain is owned by Phaser Studio Inc. The domain name is a homage to one of our favorite retro games.

We send the following 3 pieces of data to this API: The name of the template being used (vue, react, etc). If the build was 'dev' or 'prod' and finally the version of Phaser being used.

At no point is any personal data collected or sent. We don't know about your project files, device, browser or anything else. Feel free to inspect the `log.js` file to confirm this.

Why do we do this? Because being open source means we have no visible metrics about which of our templates are being used. We work hard to maintain a large and diverse set of templates for Phaser developers and this is our small anonymous way to determine if that work is actually paying off, or not. In short, it helps us ensure we're building the tools for you.

However, if you don't want to send any data, you can use these commands instead:

Dev:

```bash
npm run dev-nolog
```

Build:

```bash
npm run build-nolog
```

Or, to disable the log entirely, simply delete the file `log.js` and remove the call to it in the `scripts` section of `package.json`:

Before:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "node log.js dev & dev-template-script",
    "build": "node log.js build & build-template-script"
},
```

After:

```json
"scripts": {
    "dev": "dev-template-script",
    "build": "build-template-script"
},
```

Either of these will stop `log.js` from running. If you do decide to do this, please could you at least join our Discord and tell us which template you're using! Or send us a quick email. Either will be super-helpful, thank you.
